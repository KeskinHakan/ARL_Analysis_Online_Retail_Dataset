ARL Analysis Online Retail Dataset

The main purpose of the study to find out the relationship between the products that get by customers. When X product orders, also Y product orders too by customers according to Online Retail data. This data is including two different time between 2009 - 2010 and 2010 - 2011. In this part lets explain the ARL as much as basicly.

Association Rule Learning is a machine learning technique used to identify relationships and patterns in large datasets. It is a process of discovering frequent patterns and associations between items or attributes in a dataset.

In simple terms, Association Rule Learning aims to identify patterns that indicate the co-occurrence of items in a given dataset. For example, it can help identify that customers who buy bread are likely to buy butter as well, or that people who watch a certain TV show are more likely to watch a specific movie.

The process of Association Rule Learning involves two main steps:

Finding frequent itemsets:
The first step is to identify sets of items that appear frequently together in the dataset. This is achieved by applying a support threshold which indicates the minimum number of times an itemset must occur in the dataset to be considered frequent.

Generating association rules:
The second step involves generating association rules from the frequent itemsets identified in step one. Association rules are conditional statements that show the likelihood of an item or a set of items occurring together given the occurrence of another item or set of items. These rules are evaluated based on their confidence, which indicates the likelihood of the rule being true.

Association Rule Learning has several applications in various fields, including market basket analysis, recommender systems, and web mining. It can help businesses understand customer behavior and preferences, make recommendations to customers, and improve marketing strategies.
